# LAMP STACK IMPLIMENTATION

A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. It is essentially a set of technologies that are stacked together to build any application. Popularly known as a technology infrastructure or solutions stack, technology stack has become essential for building easy-to-maintain, scalable web applications.

Technology stack determines the type of applications you can build, the level of customizations you can perform, and the resources you need to develop your application. A technology stack consists of two primary components: a frontend stack and a backend stack. Some popular examples of tech stack include:

* The LAMP stack: Linux, Apache, MYDQL and PHP,
* LEMP stack: Nginx, MYSQL and PHP
* MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express.js AngularJS and Node.js.
* MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
